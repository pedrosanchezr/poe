# POE (PDDL Online Executor)
PDDL Online Executor

Simple FE and BE to execute PDDL problems on SGPlan and Optic (more planners can be added with just a small change)

TODO:
 - Create a mode on Codemirror for PDDL (for now it's using Scheme for sintax highlighting)
 - Improve output
 - Improve errors management (give more information to the user whenever it's possible)
 - CORS of BE is open for every origin, limit it to localhost and Heroku FE if it's going to be always in the same URL
